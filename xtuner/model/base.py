    """The base class for all training algorithms in XTuner.

    All algorithms developed based on XTuner should inherit from this class
    and implement the abstract methods in this class.

    As long as the subclass inherits and rewrites the abstract methods in this
    class, it can reuse various tool chains provided in XTuner, such as
    automatic loading of models, model inference deployment etc.

    This class inherits from `mmengine.model.BaseModel` for using the
    training capabilities provided by MMEngine; it also inherits from
    `xtuner.types.ChatBackendProtocol` for access to the tool chains related
    to deployment and evaluation.

    Note:
        After building the model, if `_is_init` is False, MMEngine will call
        `init_weights()` to initialize the model parameters. Since the LLM
        always loads pre-trained weights during training, to avoid the weights
        being overwritten, the model initialization function is turned off by
        default in the base class. If there is an algorithm that requires
        model initialization, you can call the `enable_init_weights()`
        provided by the base class and implement the corresponding
        initialization logic in `init_weights()`
