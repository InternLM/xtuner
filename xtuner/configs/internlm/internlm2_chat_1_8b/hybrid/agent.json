The values for each direction are based on the average rainfall calculated from the provided dataset. The chart should have a clear title, a legend, and be intuitive for comparing rainfall with different wind directions. Given the use of a dark theme, the overall appearance of the chart should be bright lines and filled areas on a dark background."
