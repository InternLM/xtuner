            'We present InternLM, a multilingual foundational language model '
            'with 104B parameters. InternLM is pre-trained on a large corpora '
            'with 1.6T tokens with a multi-phase progressive process, and '
            'then fine-tuned to align with human preferences. We also '
            'developed a training system called Uniscale-LLM for efficient '
            'large language model training. The evaluation on a number of '
            'benchmarks shows that InternLM achieves state-of-the-art '
            'performance in multiple aspects, including knowledge '
            'understanding, reading comprehension, mathematics, and coding. '
            'With such well-rounded capabilities, InternLM achieves '
            'outstanding performances on comprehensive exams, including '
            'MMLU, AGIEval, C-Eval and GAOKAO-Bench, without resorting to '
            'external tools. On these benchmarks, InternLM not only '
            'significantly outperforms open-source models, but also obtains '
            'superior performance compared to ChatGPT. Also, InternLM '
            'demonstrates excellent capability of understanding Chinese '
            'language and Chinese culture, which makes it a suitable '
            'foundation model to support Chinese-oriented language '
            'applications. This manuscript gives a detailed study of '
            'our results, with benchmarks and examples across a diverse '
            'set of knowledge domains and tasks.',
            'In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of '
            'pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) ranging '
            'in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.\nOur '
            'fine-tuned LLMs, called LLAMA 2-CHAT, are optimized for '
            'dialogue use cases. Our models outperform open-source chat '
            'models on most benchmarks we tested, and based on our human '
            'evaluations for helpfulness and safety, may be a suitable '
            'substitute for closedsource models. We provide a detailed '
            'description of our approach to fine-tuning and safety '
