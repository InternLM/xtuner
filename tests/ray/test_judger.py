So first, I need to figure out how many she sold in May. Half of 48 is 24, right? Because 48 divided by 2 is 24. So in May, she sold 24 clips.\n\nNow, to find the total number of clips sold in both months, I need to add the number from April and May together. That would be 48 (April) plus 24 (May). Let me do the addition: 48 + 24. Hmm, 40 + 20 is 60, and 8 + 4 is 12. So 60 + 12 is 72. So altogether, she sold 72 clips.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 48 plus 24. Yes, 48 + 20 is 68, then plus 4 more is 72. Yep, that seems right. So the total is 72.\n</think>\n\nNatalia sold 48 clips in April. In May, she sold half as many, which is 48 ÷ 2 = 24 clips. Adding both months together: 48 + 24 = 72.  \n\n#### 72"
