Let me start by visualizing a regular hexagon. A regular hexagon has six equal sides and all internal angles are equal. If it's divided into six equilateral triangles, that probably means that if you draw lines from the center of the hexagon to each of its six vertices, you end up with six triangles. \n\nNow, since the triangles are equilateral, all their sides must be equal. So each of these triangles has three sides of equal length. The perimeter of one triangle is 21 inches, so if I divide that by three, I can find the length of each side of the triangle. Let me do that calculation: 21 divided by 3 is 7. So each side of the triangle is 7 inches. \n\nBut wait, how does this relate to the hexagon? Each of these triangles is formed by two radii of the hexagon and one side of the hexagon. Wait, no, actually, if you divide the hexagon into six equilateral triangles, then each triangle's sides must be equal to the sides of the hexagon. Let me think again. \n\nIn a regular hexagon, the distance from the center to any vertex is equal to the length of each side. So if you connect the center to all six vertices, you get six equilateral triangles. Each of these triangles has two sides that are radii of the hexagon (which are equal to the side length of the hexagon) and the third side is a side of the hexagon. Therefore, if the triangle is equilateral, all three sides must be equal. That means the side length of the triangle is equal to the side length of the hexagon. \n\nTherefore, if each triangle has sides of 7 inches, then each side of the hexagon is also 7 inches. Since a regular hexagon has six sides, the perimeter would be 6 times 7 inches. Let me calculate that: 6 multiplied by 7 is 42. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If the perimeter of the triangle is 21 inches, each side is 7 inches. So each side of the hexagon is 7 inches. Therefore, the perimeter of the hexagon is 6*7=42. That seems straightforward. \n\nIs there another way this could be interpreted? Maybe if the triangles are not formed by connecting the center? But the problem says a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles. The standard way to divide a regular hexagon into equilateral triangles is by connecting the center to all the vertices, resulting in six equilateral triangles. So that must be the case here. \n\nAlternatively, if someone tried to divide the hexagon into triangles in a different way, maybe with different triangles, but the problem states that it's divided into six equilateral triangles, so that must be the standard division. \n\nTherefore, each side of the hexagon is equal to the side of the triangle, which is 7 inches. So the perimeter is 6*7=42 inches. \n\nI think that's it. Let me just make sure there isn't a trick here. Sometimes problems can have tricks, but in this case, it seems straightforward. The key is recognizing that the side length of the hexagon is the same as the side length of the equilateral triangles. Since the perimeter of the triangle is 21, each side is 7, so the hexagon's perimeter is 6*7=42.

That would mean that the radius of the hexagon (the distance from the center to a vertex) is equal to the length of each side of the hexagon. Hmm, okay, so each of those triangles is equilateral, so all their sides are equal. \n\nSo, if each of these triangles has a perimeter of 21 inches, then each side of the triangle must be 21 divided by 3, which is 7 inches. So each side of the triangle is 7 inches. But since the triangles are equilateral, all their sides are equal. Therefore, each side of the hexagon is equal to the side of the triangle, right? Because the base of each triangle is a side of the hexagon.

Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.", "response": "Okay, let's see. The problem says that a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, and if the perimeter of one of those triangles is 21 inches, we need to find the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. A regular hexagon has six equal sides, right? And if you draw lines from the center to each of the six vertices, it divides the hexagon into six equilateral triangles. Wait, so each of those triangles is equilateral? That means all their sides are equal. \n\nSo, if each triangle is equilateral, then each side of the triangle is equal to the radius of the hexagon? Or maybe the side of the hexagon? Wait, maybe I need to think about the relationship between the side of the hexagon and the sides of the triangles. Let me recall: in a regular hexagon, the length of each side is equal to the radius of the circumscribed circle. So if you connect the center to all the vertices, each of those triangles would have two sides that are radii of the circle and one side that is a side of the hexagon. But if the triangles are equilateral, then all three sides must be equal. That would mean that the radius is equal to the side length of the hexagon. So each of those triangles has sides equal to the side length of the hexagon. Therefore, each triangle is equilateral with all sides equal to the side length of the hexagon.\n\nTherefore, if the perimeter of one of these triangles is 21 inches, then each side of the triangle is 21 divided by 3, which is 7 inches. Therefore, each side of the triangle is 7 inches, which would mean that each side of the hexagon is also 7 inches. Since a regular hexagon has six sides, the perimeter would be 6 times 7, which is 42 inches. So the perimeter of the hexagon is 42 inches. \n\nWait, let me check that again. If the perimeter of the triangle is 21, then each side is 7. Since the triangle is equilateral, all sides are 7. But is the side of the triangle the same as the side of the hexagon? Let me think. If you divide the hexagon into six equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center, then each triangle has two sides that are radii of the hexagon and one side that is a side of the hexagon. But if the triangle is equilateral, then the radius must be equal to the side of the hexagon. Therefore, yes, each side of the triangle is equal to the side of the hexagon. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 7 inches. Therefore, the perimeter is 6*7=42. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the regular hexagon as being made up of six equilateral triangles. But if you think of it as being divided into six equilateral triangles, maybe they are not the ones from the center. Wait, but the problem says \"divided into six equilateral triangles.\" How exactly is that done? Maybe another way? For example, if you divide the hexagon into triangles by drawing lines from one vertex to all non-adjacent vertices? But that might not result in equilateral triangles. \n\nWait, but a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles by connecting the center to all six vertices. Let me confirm that. Let me recall that in a regular hexagon, the distance from the center to any vertex is equal to the length of each side. So if you connect the center to each vertex, you get six triangles. Each of those triangles has two sides that are radii (equal to the side length of the hexagon) and the included angle is 60 degrees because the full circle is 360 degrees divided by 6, which is 60 degrees. So if two sides are equal and the included angle is 60 degrees, then the triangle is equilateral. Because if you have a triangle with two sides equal and the angle between them 60 degrees, then the third side can be found using the law of cosines: c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab cos(theta). If a = b and theta is 60 degrees, then c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + a\u00b2 - 2*a*a*cos(60\u00b0). Cos(60\u00b0) is 0.5, so c\u00b2 = 2a\u00b2 - 2a\u00b2*(0.5) = 2a\u00b2 - a\u00b2 = a\u00b2. Therefore, c = a. Therefore, the third side is equal to the other two sides, so the triangle is equilateral. \n\nTherefore, each of those triangles is indeed equilateral. Therefore, each side of the triangle is equal to the side of the hexagon. Therefore, if the perimeter of the triangle is 21 inches, each side is 7 inches, so the side of the hexagon is 7 inches. Therefore, the perimeter of the hexagon is 6*7=42 inches. \n\nBut just to make sure there isn't another way to divide the hexagon into six equilateral triangles. For example, maybe dividing it into different triangles? But I think the standard way is dividing from the center. If you divide it another way, maybe you can't get equilateral triangles. For example, if you divide it into triangles by connecting different points. But in a regular hexagon, if you connect every other vertex, you can form equilateral triangles, but maybe not six of them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to dividing the hexagon into six equilateral triangles in some other way. But given that the problem says \"a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles,\" and given that the standard division is into six equilateral triangles by connecting the center, I think that's the way to go. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct.

The regular hexagon is divided into six equilateral triangles. So each triangle has sides equal to the radius of the hexagon. But in a regular hexagon, the side length is equal to the radius. So if each triangle's side is 7 inches, then the side of the hexagon is 7 inches. Therefore, the perimeter is 6*7=42. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the perimeter of the triangle.

Therefore, the hexagon's perimeter is 6 times that. \n\nWait, but is there another way that the hexagon could be divided into six equilateral triangles? For example, maybe dividing it into triangles that are not from the center? But no, the standard way to divide a regular hexagon into six equilateral triangles is by connecting the center to the vertices. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangles are arranged differently. But if the hexagon is regular, then all those triangles must be congruent and equilateral. So I think my initial reasoning is correct. \n\nLet me check with another approach. Let's say the side length of the hexagon is 's'. Then each of those six triangles has sides of length 's', because they are equilateral. Therefore, the perimeter of each triangle is 3s. According to the problem, that perimeter is 21 inches. So 3s = 21, which gives s = 7. Then the perimeter of the hexagon is 6s = 6*7 = 42 inches. \n\nYes, that seems straightforward. So the answer should be 42 inches. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me think if there's any alternative interpretation. For example, if the hexagon was divided into six equilateral triangles in a different way, maybe not all from the center. But in that case, the triangles might not be equilateral. For example, if you divide the hexagon into triangles by drawing lines from one vertex to others, you might get different triangles. But in a regular hexagon, if you divide it into six equilateral triangles, it has to be done by connecting the center. \n\nAnother thought: maybe the triangles are not all congruent? But the problem says \"a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles,\" which suggests that they are congruent. So each triangle is equilateral and congruent. Therefore, each side of the triangle is equal to the side of the hexagon. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangles are not all having sides equal to the hexagon's sides. Wait, but if you divide the hexagon into six equilateral triangles, each triangle must have sides that are either sides of the hexagon or radii. But if they are equilateral, then the radii must be equal to the sides of the hexagon. \n\nSo, in a regular hexagon, the side length is equal to the radius. So that's a property of regular hexagons. Therefore, if each triangle has sides equal to the radius, which is equal to the side length of the hexagon, then the perimeter of each triangle is 3s, which is 21, so s=7, perimeter of hexagon is 6s=42. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 42. \n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning. So I think the perimeter of the regular hexagon is 42 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe perimeter of the regular hexagon is \\boxed{42} inches.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the perimeter of a regular hexagon that is divided into six equilateral triangles, we start by analyzing the relationship between the triangles and the hexagon.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Structure\n\nA **regular hexagon** has six equal sides and six equal angles.

Let me start by visualizing a regular hexagon. A regular hexagon has six equal sides and all internal angles are equal. If you draw lines from the center to each of the six vertices, it divides the hexagon into six equilateral triangles. \n\nWait, the problem says that the perimeter of one of the triangles is 21 inches. Since the triangles are equilateral, all three sides are equal. So, if the perimeter is 21 inches, each side of the triangle must be 21 divided by 3. Let me calculate that. 21 divided by 3 is 7. So each side of the triangle is 7 inches. \n\nBut hold on, what exactly are the sides of these triangles? In a regular hexagon, when you connect the center to the vertices, each of those triangles has two sides that are radii of the hexagon and one side that is a side of the hexagon. Wait, but if the triangles are equilateral, then all sides must be equal. That means the radius of the hexagon (the distance from the center to a vertex) is equal to the length of the side of the hexagon. \n\nSo, if each triangle has sides of 7 inches, then each side of the hexagon is also 7 inches.

Since it's equilateral, each side is 7 inches. But in the hexagon, each side of the triangle that's also a side of the hexagon is 7 inches. But the other two sides of the triangle are radii of the hexagon. However, since the triangle is equilateral, those radii must also be 7 inches. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is equal to the radius. \n\nBut in a regular hexagon, the side length is equal to the radius of the circumscribed circle. So that's correct.

Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.", "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the perimeter of a regular hexagon that's divided into six equilateral triangles, and each of those triangles has a perimeter of 21 inches. Let me start by recalling what a regular hexagon is. A regular hexagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. When they say it's divided into six equilateral triangles, I imagine that if you draw lines from the center of the hexagon to each of its six vertices, you end up with six triangles. \n\nNow, if those triangles are equilateral, that means all their sides are equal. So each of these triangles has three sides of equal length. But wait, in a regular hexagon, the sides of the triangles would be the same as the sides of the hexagon, right? Because the sides of the triangles are from the center to the vertices, which are radii of the circumscribed circle around the hexagon. But hold on, in a regular hexagon, the length of the side of the hexagon is equal to the radius of the circumscribed circle. So if the triangles are equilateral, then the radius is equal to the side length of the hexagon. \n\nBut let me confirm that. Let me think about the properties of a regular hexagon. A regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center to each vertex. Each of those triangles is equilateral because all the sides are equal. The sides of the triangles would be the radius of the circumscribed circle, and the base of each triangle would be a side of the hexagon. So if the triangles are equilateral, then the radius is equal to the side length of the hexagon. Therefore, each of those triangles has sides equal to the side length of the hexagon. \n\nSo if the perimeter of one of these triangles is 21 inches, then each side of the triangle is 21 divided by 3, which is 7 inches. Therefore, each side of the triangle is 7 inches. Since the side of the triangle is equal to the side of the hexagon, that would mean each side of the hexagon is 7 inches. \n\nThen, the perimeter of the hexagon would be 6 times the length of one side. So 6 multiplied by 7 inches is 42 inches. Therefore, the perimeter of the regular hexagon is 42 inches. \n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me visualize the hexagon again. If you divide a regular hexagon into six equilateral triangles, each triangle has two sides that are radii of the hexagon and one side that is a side of the hexagon. But if the triangle is equilateral, then all three sides must be equal. Therefore, the radius is equal to the side length of the hexagon. So yes, each side of the triangle is equal to the side of the hexagon. Therefore, if the perimeter of the triangle is 21, each side is 7, so the hexagon's side is 7. Then perimeter is 6*7=42. \n\nBut let me think again. Maybe the triangles are not the ones formed by the center. Maybe they are different triangles? Wait, the problem says \"a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles.\" So maybe there's another way to divide it? But usually, the standard way is dividing from the center. But maybe the problem is referring to something else? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the hexagon is divided into six equilateral triangles in another way? For example, if you divide it into triangles by drawing lines from one vertex? But that would not result in six equilateral triangles. Let me think. A regular hexagon has six sides. If you connect all the vertices, you can divide it into different triangles. But if you divide it into six equilateral triangles, then the way is probably from the center. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to a different division. But I think the standard division is into six equilateral triangles with the center. So assuming that, then the perimeter of each triangle is 21. Each triangle has three sides, each equal to the side of the hexagon. Therefore, each side is 7. Hence, the perimeter of the hexagon is 6*7=42. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangles are not all the same? Wait, no, the problem says \"divided into six equilateral triangles,\" so they must all be equilateral. So if each triangle has perimeter 21, then each side is 7. Therefore, the hexagon's side is 7. \n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let me recall that in a regular hexagon, the side length is equal to the radius. So if you have a regular hexagon with side length 's', then the distance from the center to any vertex is also 's'. Therefore, if you connect the center to all six vertices, you get six equilateral triangles, each with sides of length 's'. Therefore, the perimeter of each triangle is 3s. \n\nGiven that 3s = 21, so s = 7. Then the perimeter of the hexagon is 6s = 42. So that seems consistent. \n\nBut maybe the problem is referring to a different division? Let me think. For example, if you divide the hexagon into triangles that are not from the center. For instance, if you divide it into six equilateral triangles by drawing lines from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side? But I don't think that would result in equilateral triangles. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the hexagon is divided into six equilateral triangles in some other configuration. But I think the standard way is the one from the center. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to a different kind of division. For example, if you divide the hexagon into six equilateral triangles, but each triangle is not necessarily having the center. But in that case, how would that work? For example, if you have a regular hexagon, and you divide it into six equilateral triangles, each triangle would have to have sides equal to the side of the hexagon. But how would that fit? \n\nLet me try to imagine. If you take a regular hexagon and try to divide it into six equilateral triangles. If you take one triangle, then another, etc. But since a regular hexagon can be thought of as six equilateral triangles joined at their bases. Wait, no. If you have a regular hexagon, each internal angle is 120 degrees. If you try to divide it into equilateral triangles, which have 60-degree angles. So maybe you need to split it into smaller triangles. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not referring to the triangles formed by the center, but maybe splitting the hexagon into smaller equilateral triangles? For example, if you divide each side into segments and create smaller triangles. But then the number of triangles would be more than six. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to a different approach. Let me check the problem again: \"A regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles. If the perimeter of one of the triangles is 21 inches, what is the perimeter, in inches, of the regular hexagon?\" \n\nSo the problem says that the hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles. So maybe the way it's divided is such that each triangle has one side as a side of the hexagon. But if you have six triangles, each sharing a side with the hexagon. But how? \n\nWait, if you divide the hexagon into six equilateral triangles, each triangle would have to have one side as a side of the hexagon. But then, how would that work? For example, if you take one side of the hexagon and form an equilateral triangle on it, but then you would have to do that for each side. However, if you do that, you would have six equilateral triangles attached to the hexagon, but that would not divide the hexagon itself, but rather create a star shape or something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the hexagon is divided into six equilateral triangles by drawing lines from one vertex. For example, if you take one vertex and draw lines to all non-adjacent vertices. But in a hexagon, drawing lines from one vertex to others would divide it into four triangles, not six. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the hexagon is divided into six equilateral triangles by some other method. But I can't think of a way. Maybe the problem is referring to the standard division into six equilateral triangles by connecting the center. \n\nIn that case, each triangle has two sides that are radii of the hexagon and one side that is a side of the hexagon. If those triangles are equilateral, then the radius must be equal to the side of the hexagon. Therefore, each triangle has sides equal to the side of the hexagon, so perimeter 3s = 21, so s = 7. Then the perimeter of the hexagon is 6s = 42. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to a different division where the triangles are not formed by the center. But if that's the case, then how? Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the regular hexagon is divided into six equilateral triangles. Let me consider the side length of the hexagon as 's'. If each triangle is equilateral, then each triangle must have sides of length 's'. But how can you fit six equilateral triangles into a hexagon? \n\nIf you think of a regular hexagon as being made up of six equilateral triangles, then it's like a honeycomb pattern.

Hmm, polar coordinates are (r, \u03b8), right? Where r is the distance from the origin and \u03b8 is the angle from the positive x-axis. Let me recall the formulas for conversion.\n\nI think the formulas are r = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) and \u03b8 = arctan(y/x). But wait, I have to be careful with the angle because arctan might not always give me the correct quadrant. Since the point is (0, 3), which is on the positive y-axis, maybe that's straightforward?\n\nFirst, let me compute r. The formula is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Here, x is 0 and y is 3. So plugging in, r = sqrt(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = sqrt(0 + 9) = sqrt(9) = 3. Okay, so r is 3. That seems simple enough.\n\nNow for \u03b8. The formula is arctan(y/x). But here, x is 0, so y/x is 3/0. Wait, division by zero? That's undefined. Hmm, so arctan(3/0) is undefined. But I know that when x is 0 and y is positive, the angle should be \u03c0/2 radians, which is 90 degrees. Because that's straight up the positive y-axis. Let me confirm that.\n\nIn polar coordinates, \u03b8 is measured from the positive x-axis. So if the point is on the positive y-axis, that's a 90-degree angle. So \u03b8 should be \u03c0/2. But let me think again. If I use the arctan(y/x), since x is 0, but y is positive, then the angle is \u03c0/2. However, sometimes calculators or formulas might give different results depending on the quadrant. But since x is 0, it's not in any quadrant, it's on the axis. So I think \u03b8 is \u03c0/2.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to compute \u03b8. Maybe using the coordinates. Since the point is (0, 3), which is straight up the y-axis. So in polar coordinates, that should be (r, \u03c0/2). But let me make sure that there isn't a different representation. For example, sometimes angles can be represented in different ways, but since the problem specifies 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 2\u03c0, \u03c0/2 is within that range.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the unit circle, the point (0, 1) is at \u03c0/2, so (0, 3) would be 3 units in that direction, so same angle. So \u03b8 is \u03c0/2.\n\nWait, but what if I use the arctan2 function? Which takes into account the signs of x and y. But since x is 0 and y is positive, arctan2(y, x) would give \u03c0/2. So that's consistent.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's a different way. Let me think. If I have a point (x, y), then \u03b8 is the angle such that tan \u03b8 = y/x. But when x is 0, tan \u03b8 is undefined. But tan \u03b8 is sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8. So if x is 0, then cos \u03b8 is 0, which occurs at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 and 3\u03c0/2. But since y is positive, then sin \u03b8 is positive, so \u03b8 must be \u03c0/2. Because at 3\u03c0/2, sin \u03b8 is negative. So yes, \u03b8 is \u03c0/2.\n\nSo putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2). Let me check if that makes sense. If I convert (3, \u03c0/2) back to rectangular coordinates, I should get (r cos \u03b8, r sin \u03b8) = (3 cos \u03c0/2, 3 sin \u03c0/2). Cos \u03c0/2 is 0, sin \u03c0/2 is 1, so (0, 3). Perfect, that's the original point. So that checks out.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to enter the answer in the form (r, \u03b8) where r > 0 and 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 2\u03c0. So 3 is positive, and \u03c0/2 is between 0 and 2\u03c0. So that's correct.\n\nIs there another possible answer? For example, could \u03b8 be something else? Like \u03c0/2 + 2\u03c0? But no, because \u03b8 has to be less than 2\u03c0. So \u03c0/2 is the only one in that interval. Also, since r is positive, we don't have to consider negative r values. If r were negative, we could add \u03c0 to \u03b8, but since r is positive, we don't need to do that.\n\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2). I think that's the answer. Let me just recap:\n\nGiven (x, y) = (0, 3).\n\nr = sqrt(0^2 + 3^2) = 3.\n\n\u03b8 is \u03c0/2 because the point is on the positive y-axis.\n\nSo (r, \u03b8) = (3, \u03c0/2).\n\nYep, that seems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that when x is 0, the angle is \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2 depending on the sign of y. Since y is positive, it's \u03c0/2. All checks confirm that. So I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polar coordinates are \\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the rectangular coordinates $(0, 3)$ to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, we follow the standard conversion formulas:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Compute the radial distance $r$\n\nThe formula for $r$ is:\n\n$$\nr = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n$$\n\nSubstituting $x = 0$ and $y = 3$:\n\n$$\nr = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n$$\n\nSo, $r = 3$.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine the angle $\\theta$\n\nThe angle $\\theta$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)\n$$\n\nHowever, in this case, $x = 0$, which makes the expression $\\frac{y}{x}$ undefined.

Hmm, let me remember how to do this. I think polar coordinates are given as (r, \u03b8), where r is the distance from the origin and \u03b8 is the angle from the positive x-axis. \n\nFirst, I recall that to convert from rectangular (x, y) to polar (r, \u03b8), the formulas are:\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\nand\n\u03b8 = arctan(y/x)\n\nBut wait, I also remember that \u03b8 might need adjustment depending on the quadrant where the point is located. Since the original point is (0, 3), that's on the positive y-axis. Let me visualize that. If x is 0 and y is positive, then the point is straight up along the y-axis. So, in terms of angles, that should be \u03c0/2 radians, right? Because 0 radians is along the positive x-axis, \u03c0/2 is straight up, \u03c0 is negative x-axis, etc.\n\nBut let me go through the formulas step by step to make sure. Let's compute r first. Using the formula:\n\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3. Okay, so r is 3. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow for \u03b8. The formula is arctan(y/x). But here, x is 0. So we have arctan(3/0). Wait, division by zero. That's undefined. So how do we handle that? Well, since x is 0 and y is positive, the point is on the positive y-axis, so \u03b8 should be \u03c0/2. But let me think again. If I use the arctan(y/x), since x is 0, the tangent of \u03b8 would be undefined, which occurs at \u03c0/2. So that makes sense. \n\nBut sometimes, depending on the calculator or the method, you might have to consider the quadrant. Since x is 0, the point is on the y-axis. So, if y is positive, it's in the positive y-axis, which is quadrant I? Wait, actually, the quadrants are defined as follows: quadrant I is x>0, y>0; quadrant II is x<0, y>0; quadrant III x<0, y<0; quadrant IV x>0, y<0. But the y-axis itself isn't part of any quadrant. However, when converting, we can still assign an angle. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. \n\nBut let me check with another approach. Sometimes, \u03b8 can be calculated using arctan2(y, x), which takes into account the signs of x and y. But since I don't have a calculator here, I need to think. Since x is 0 and y is positive, arctan2(3, 0) would give \u03c0/2. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the unit circle, the point (0, 1) corresponds to \u03b8 = \u03c0/2. So scaling that up by 3, the point (0, 3) would still be at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2. \n\nBut let me also think about the possible angles. Since r must be positive, and \u03b8 between 0 and 2\u03c0. So \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. So the polar coordinates would be (3, \u03c0/2). \n\nWait, but let me make sure there isn't another angle that could represent the same point. For example, if \u03b8 was 5\u03c0/2, that's equivalent to \u03c0/2, but since \u03b8 has to be between 0 and 2\u03c0, 5\u03c0/2 is more than 2\u03c0, so it's not allowed. So \u03c0/2 is the correct angle here. \n\nIs there a possibility that \u03b8 could be something else? For example, if I had a negative r, but the problem specifies r > 0, so we can't have that. So no, r is positive, so \u03b8 must be \u03c0/2. \n\nLet me check with another example. Suppose I have (0, 5). Converting to polar coordinates, it would be (5, \u03c0/2). Similarly, (0, -3) would be (3, 3\u03c0/2). So yes, that makes sense. \n\nSo for (0, 3), it's (3, \u03c0/2). \n\nBut let me just verify with the formulas again. If I use \u03b8 = arctan(y/x), but since x is 0, we can't compute that directly. However, if I take the limit as x approaches 0 from the positive side, arctan(y/x) would approach \u03c0/2. Similarly, if x approaches 0 from the negative side, arctan(y/x) would approach -\u03c0/2, but since y is positive, and x approaches 0 from negative side, y/x approaches negative infinity, so arctan(-infty) is -\u03c0/2. But since we need \u03b8 between 0 and 2\u03c0, we can add 2\u03c0 to -\u03c0/2 to get 3\u03c0/2. But in our case, x is exactly 0, not approaching from either side. But since the point is (0, 3), which is on the positive y-axis, so \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. \n\nAlternatively, if I use the equations:\n\nx = r cos \u03b8\n\ny = r sin \u03b8\n\nSo for (0, 3):\n\n0 = r cos \u03b8\n\n3 = r sin \u03b8\n\nSince r is 3, as we found earlier, then:\n\n0 = 3 cos \u03b8 => cos \u03b8 = 0\n\n3 = 3 sin \u03b8 => sin \u03b8 = 1\n\nSo \u03b8 is the angle where cosine is 0 and sine is 1. That occurs at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2. \n\nYes, that's solid. So \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. \n\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2). \n\nI think that's it. Let me just check if there's any chance I messed up the quadrant or something. Since x is 0, it's not in any quadrant, but the angle is straightforward. If I had a point like (0, -3), then \u03b8 would be 3\u03c0/2, but since it's (0, 3), it's \u03c0/2. \n\nAnother check: if I convert (3, \u03c0/2) back to rectangular coordinates, I should get (0, 3). Let's see:\n\nx = r cos \u03b8 = 3 cos(\u03c0/2) = 3 * 0 = 0\n\ny = r sin \u03b8 = 3 sin(\u03c0/2) = 3 * 1 = 3\n\nYes, that gives (0, 3). Perfect. So that's correct.\n\nSo I think the answer is (3, \u03c0/2). \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polar coordinates are \\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the rectangular coordinates $(0, 3)$ to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, we use the standard conversion formulas:\n\n$$\nr = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Compute $ r $\n\nGiven $ x = 0 $ and $ y = 3 $:\n\n$$\nr = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n$$\n\nSo, the radial distance $ r = 3 $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine $ \\theta $\n\nNow we compute the angle $ \\theta $.

Hmm, polar coordinates are given as (r, \u03b8), right? Where r is the distance from the origin and \u03b8 is the angle from the positive x-axis. Let me recall the formulas for conversion.\n\nI think the formulas are r = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) and \u03b8 = arctan(y/x). But wait, I need to be careful with the angle because arctan might not always give me the correct quadrant. Since the point is (0, 3), which is on the positive y-axis, maybe the angle is straightforward?\n\nLet me start with calculating r. For the point (0, 3), x is 0 and y is 3. Plugging into the formula for r: r = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3. Okay, so r is 3. That seems simple enough.\n\nNow for \u03b8. The formula is \u03b8 = arctan(y/x). But here, x is 0, so y/x is 3/0, which is undefined. Hmm, division by zero. That means the tangent of \u03b8 is undefined. When is tangent undefined? Tangent is sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8, so it's undefined when cos\u03b8 is 0. That happens at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 and 3\u03c0/2. But since the original point is (0, 3), which is on the positive y-axis, \u03b8 should be \u03c0/2 radians, right? Because that's straight up along the y-axis.\n\nBut let me make sure. If I think about the coordinate system, the point (0, 3) is straight up the y-axis. So in polar coordinates, that would be 3 units away from the origin at an angle of 90 degrees, which is \u03c0/2 radians. So \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. \n\nBut wait, sometimes when using arctan(y/x), you have to consider the quadrant. However, since x is 0 here, it's not in any quadrant, it's on the axis. So maybe there's a special case here. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the arctan2 function, which takes into account the signs of x and y to determine the correct quadrant. But since x is 0 and y is positive, arctan2(y, x) would give \u03c0/2. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. Therefore, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2). Let me verify this. If I convert (3, \u03c0/2) back to rectangular coordinates, I should get (r cos \u03b8, r sin \u03b8). So 3 cos(\u03c0/2) is 3*0 = 0, and 3 sin(\u03c0/2) is 3*1 = 3. Yep, that gives (0, 3), which matches the original point. So that checks out.\n\nWait, but what if someone thought \u03b8 could be 3\u03c0/2? Well, 3\u03c0/2 is pointing downward along the negative y-axis. If you plug in \u03b8 = 3\u03c0/2, then r would be 3, but then the coordinates would be (3 cos 3\u03c0/2, 3 sin 3\u03c0/2) = (0, -3), which is not our original point. So \u03b8 has to be \u03c0/2.\n\nAnother way to think about it: since the point is on the positive y-axis, the angle is \u03c0/2. Also, since r must be positive, which it is (3), and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0, \u03c0/2 is within that range. So all conditions are satisfied.\n\nI don't think there's any other possible \u03b8 that would work here. Let me just think if there's any other angle that could result in (0, 3). For example, if \u03b8 was \u03c0/2 + 2\u03c0, that's 5\u03c0/2, but since \u03b8 is supposed to be between 0 and 2\u03c0, we don't consider that. Similarly, \u03b8 could be \u03c0/2 minus 2\u03c0, but that would be negative, which is not allowed. So \u03c0/2 is the only angle in the required range.\n\nSo I think the answer is (3, \u03c0/2). Let me just check if there's any alternative way someone might approach this problem and maybe make a mistake. For example, if someone tried to use \u03b8 = arctan(y/x) and didn't consider the division by zero, they might get confused. But since x is zero, it's a special case. So it's important to recognize that when x is zero, the point lies on the y-axis, so \u03b8 is \u03c0/2 if y is positive, and 3\u03c0/2 if y is negative.\n\nAnother check: if I use the formula \u03b8 = arctan(y/x) but since x is 0, maybe some calculators or software might give an error, but mathematically, we know that when x=0 and y>0, \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. So that's the right approach.\n\nTherefore, I feel confident that the polar coordinates for (0, 3) are (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polar coordinates are \\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the rectangular coordinates $(0, 3)$ to polar coordinates, we use the standard formulas for conversion:\n\n$$\nr = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \\quad \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Compute $r$\n\nGiven $x = 0$ and $y = 3$:\n\n$$\nr = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n$$\n\nSo, the radial distance $r$ is **3**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine $\\theta$\n\nThe angle $\\theta$ is determined by the arctangent of $\\frac{y}{x}$.

But here, since y is positive, \u03c0/2 is correct.\n\nLet me also think about the general case. If I have a point (0, y), then r is |y|, and \u03b8 is \u03c0/2 if y > 0, and 3\u03c0/2 if y < 0. Since our y is 3, which is positive, \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. So that seems right.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me recall that \u03b8 is calculated using arctan2(y, x) in some contexts, which takes into account the signs of both x and y. But in this case, since x is 0, arctan2(y, 0) would give \u03c0/2 when y is positive, and -\u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2 when y is negative.

Hmm, let me remember how to do this. I think polar coordinates are given as (r, \u03b8), where r is the distance from the origin and \u03b8 is the angle from the positive x-axis. Right?\n\nFirst, I should find r. The formula for r is the square root of (x squared plus y squared). So in this case, x is 0 and y is 3. Let me write that down:\n\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3. Okay, so r is 3. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow for \u03b8. The formula for \u03b8 is usually arctangent of y over x, right? So \u03b8 = arctan(y/x). But wait, here x is 0. So that would be arctan(3/0). Hmm, division by zero. That's undefined. So I need to think about this. When x is 0, the point is on the y-axis. Since y is positive (3), the point (0, 3) is on the positive y-axis. So what angle corresponds to that?\n\nIn polar coordinates, the angle \u03b8 is measured from the positive x-axis. So if the point is on the positive y-axis, that's 90 degrees, or \u03c0/2 radians. Let me confirm. If I imagine the unit circle, moving counterclockwise from the positive x-axis, \u03c0/2 radians would point straight up along the y-axis. So yes, \u03b8 should be \u03c0/2.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there isn't a different angle that could also satisfy this. Since the original coordinates are (0, 3), which is straight up, there's no ambiguity here. The angle is definitely \u03c0/2. But just to check, if I use the arctangent formula, even though x is zero, arctan(y/x) would be arctan(inf), which is \u03c0/2. So that also gives me \u03c0/2. So that's consistent.\n\nBut I remember that sometimes when using arctan, you have to consider the quadrant. But in this case, since x is 0, the point is on the boundary between quadrants. But since y is positive, it's on the positive y-axis, which is between the first and second quadrants. But since x is zero, it's not in any quadrant, but the angle is still \u03c0/2.\n\nSo putting it all together, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2). Let me check if there's any other possible angles. The problem says to have r > 0 and 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 2\u03c0. Since r is 3, which is positive, and \u03b8 is \u03c0/2, which is between 0 and 2\u03c0, that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me recall that sometimes people use different conventions, but I think in standard polar coordinates, \u03b8 is measured from the positive x-axis, counterclockwise.

Yes, that makes sense.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me recall that \u03b8 is measured from the positive x-axis, counterclockwise. So if the point is straight up on the y-axis, that's a quarter turn, which is \u03c0/2. So \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. Therefore, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that r is positive and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0. Since r is 3, which is positive, and \u03b8 is \u03c0/2, which is between 0 and 2\u03c0, that should be correct.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to represent this point. For example, sometimes polar coordinates can have negative r, but the problem specifies r > 0, so we don't have to consider that. Also, \u03b8 is supposed to be in [0, 2\u03c0), so \u03c0/2 is within that range.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the unit circle, the point (0, 3) is 3 units up the y-axis. So in polar coordinates, that's 3 units at an angle of \u03c0/2. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAnother way to think about it: if I have a point (x, y) = (0, 3), then in polar coordinates, x = r cos \u03b8 and y = r sin \u03b8. So substituting, 0 = 3 cos \u03b8 and 3 = 3 sin \u03b8. Dividing both sides by 3, we get cos \u03b8 = 0 and sin \u03b8 = 1. The angle \u03b8 that satisfies both is \u03c0/2. Perfect, that confirms it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2). I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just visualize it again. If I start at the origin, go 3 units in the direction of \u03c0/2 radians (which is straight up), I end up at (0, 3). Yep, that's exactly the point given. So I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polar coordinates are \\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the rectangular coordinates $(0, 3)$ to polar coordinates, we use the standard formulas for conversion:\n\n$$\nr = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \\quad \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)\n$$\n\nHowever, since $x = 0$ in this case, the formula $\\theta = \\arctan(y/x)$ is undefined due to division by zero.

Hmm, polar coordinates are given as (r, \u03b8), right? Where r is the distance from the origin, and \u03b8 is the angle from the positive x-axis. Let me recall the formulas for conversion.\n\nI think the formulas are r = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) and \u03b8 = arctan(y/x). But wait, I need to be careful with the angle because arctan might not always give me the correct quadrant. Since the point (0, 3) is on the y-axis, maybe that's straightforward?\n\nFirst, let me compute r. The x-coordinate is 0 and the y-coordinate is 3. So plugging into the formula for r: sqrt(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = sqrt(0 + 9) = sqrt(9) = 3. Okay, so r is 3. That seems simple enough.\n\nNow for \u03b8. The formula is arctan(y/x). But here, x is 0, so y/x is 3/0, which is undefined. Hmm. So arctan of something undefined... That makes sense because the point is on the y-axis. So when x is 0, the angle \u03b8 is either \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2 depending on the sign of y. Since y is positive 3, it should be \u03c0/2. Let me confirm.\n\nIn the coordinate system, the point (0, 3) is straight up along the positive y-axis. So the angle from the positive x-axis to that point is 90 degrees, which is \u03c0/2 radians. So \u03b8 should be \u03c0/2. But let me check if there's any other consideration here.\n\nWait, sometimes when using arctan(y/x), you have to adjust the angle based on the quadrant. But since x is 0, the standard arctan function can't handle that. So in this case, since x is 0 and y is positive, \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. If y were negative, it would be 3\u03c0/2, but since it's positive, \u03c0/2 is correct.\n\nBut let me think again. What if I use the formula \u03b8 = arctan2(y, x)? I remember that some calculators or programming languages have an arctan2 function that takes into account the signs of both x and y to determine the correct quadrant. In this case, since x is 0 and y is positive, arctan2(3, 0) would give \u03c0/2. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, combining r and \u03b8, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2). Let me check if this makes sense. If I convert back from polar to rectangular, x = r cos \u03b8 = 3 cos(\u03c0/2) = 3 * 0 = 0, and y = r sin \u03b8 = 3 sin(\u03c0/2) = 3 * 1 = 3. Yep, that gives me (0, 3), which matches the original point. So that seems correct.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't skip any steps. Let me recap:\n\nGiven (x, y) = (0, 3):\n\nr = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(0 + 9) = 3.\n\n\u03b8: Since x = 0 and y > 0, \u03b8 is \u03c0/2.\n\nSo the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2). And since r is positive and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0, this satisfies the requirements.\n\nI don't think there's any other possible answer here. For example, if someone thought \u03b8 could be 3\u03c0/2, but that would correspond to (0, -3), which is not the case here. So \u03c0/2 is definitely the right angle.\n\nAnother thing to check: sometimes polar coordinates can have negative r values, but the problem specifies r > 0, so we don't have to consider that. Also, \u03b8 is supposed to be between 0 and 2\u03c0, which \u03c0/2 is.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polar coordinates are \\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the rectangular coordinates $(0, 3)$ to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, we use the standard conversion formulas:\n\n$$\nr = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \\quad \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)\n$$\n\nHowever, when $x = 0$, the arctangent function becomes undefined.

Hmm, let me remember how to do this. I think polar coordinates are given as (r, \u03b8), where r is the distance from the origin and \u03b8 is the angle from the positive x-axis. Right?\n\nFirst, I need to find r. The formula for r is the square root of (x squared plus y squared). So, in this case, x is 0 and y is 3. Let me plug those in. So r = sqrt(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = sqrt(0 + 9) = sqrt(9) = 3. Okay, that seems straightforward. So r is 3. Got that part.\n\nNow, the tricky part is finding \u03b8. The angle. I remember that \u03b8 can be found using the arctangent function, specifically \u03b8 = arctan(y/x). But wait, here x is 0. So that would be arctan(3/0). But division by zero is undefined. Hmm, that's a problem. How do I handle that?\n\nWell, maybe I should think about where the point (0, 3) is located. In rectangular coordinates, (0, 3) is straight up along the y-axis. So, that's on the positive y-axis. So, in terms of angles, the positive y-axis is at \u03c0/2 radians, which is 90 degrees. So, is \u03b8 just \u03c0/2?\n\nBut let me verify that with the formulas. Since x is 0, and y is positive, the point is on the positive y-axis. So, the angle should be \u03c0/2. But let me think again about the arctangent formula. Normally, \u03b8 = arctan(y/x), but when x is 0, we have to consider the quadrant. Since x is 0, the point is on the y-axis. Since y is positive, it's in the positive y-axis, so \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. If y were negative, it would be 3\u03c0/2. But here, it's positive, so \u03c0/2.\n\nBut wait, sometimes calculators or formulas might give different results. Let me check if there's another way to calculate \u03b8. Maybe using cosine and sine? Since cos \u03b8 = x/r and sin \u03b8 = y/r. So, cos \u03b8 = 0/3 = 0, and sin \u03b8 = 3/3 = 1. So, what angle has cosine 0 and sine 1? That's \u03c0/2. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. Therefore, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2). Let me just make sure there's no other possible angle. Since r is positive, and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0, \u03c0/2 is within that range. So that's the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, sometimes when converting, there are multiple angles that could represent the same point, but since they specified r > 0 and 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 2\u03c0, we need to make sure we pick the right one. For example, if \u03b8 was 5\u03c0/2, that's equivalent to \u03c0/2, but 5\u03c0/2 is more than 2\u03c0, so it's not in the required range. So \u03c0/2 is the correct angle here.\n\nAnother thing to check: if the original point was (0, -3), then \u03b8 would be 3\u03c0/2. But since it's (0, 3), it's \u03c0/2. So that makes sense.\n\nI think that's all. So the answer is (3, \u03c0/2). Let me just recap:\n\nGiven (x, y) = (0, 3):\n\nr = sqrt(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = 3\n\n\u03b8 = arctan(y/x) but since x=0 and y>0, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\n\nTherefore, polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2).

Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the function again to make sure I have it right: f(x) = (3x - 2)/(x - 2). Yep, that's what's given. So for each of the inputs -2, -1, and 0, I need to plug them into this function.\n\nStarting with f(-2). Let me substitute x = -2 into the function. So that would be (3*(-2) - 2)/(-2 - 2). Let me calculate the numerator and denominator separately to avoid mistakes.\n\nNumerator: 3 times -2 is -6, then subtract 2. So -6 - 2 equals -8. Denominator: -2 - 2 is -4. So f(-2) is -8 divided by -4. Dividing two negatives gives a positive, so that's 2. Okay, so f(-2) is 2. Got that.\n\nNext, f(-1). Let me substitute x = -1. So numerator is 3*(-1) - 2. That's -3 - 2, which is -5. Denominator is -1 - 2, which is -3. So f(-1) is -5 divided by -3. Again, two negatives make a positive, so that's 5/3. Hmm, 5 over 3. Alright, so f(-1) is 5/3.\n\nNow, moving on to f(0). Substitute x = 0 into the function. Numerator: 3*0 - 2. That's 0 - 2, which is -2. Denominator: 0 - 2, which is -2. So f(0) is -2 divided by -2.

Maybe perform polynomial division or see if it can be simplified. Let me try dividing 3x - 2 by x - 2.\n\nDividing 3x - 2 by x - 2. How many times does x go into 3x? 3 times. Multiply 3 by (x - 2) gives 3x - 6. Subtract that from 3x - 2: (3x - 2) - (3x - 6) = 0x + 4. So the division gives 3 + 4/(x - 2). Therefore, f(x) can be written as 3 + 4/(x - 2). Maybe this form is easier for evaluation? Let me check with x = -2.\n\nUsing the simplified form: 3 + 4/(-2 - 2) = 3 + 4/(-4) = 3 - 1 = 2. Which matches the previous result. Good.\n\nFor x = -1: 3 + 4/(-1 - 2) = 3 + 4/(-3) = 3 - 4/3 = 9/3 - 4/3 = 5/3. Correct again.\n\nFor x = 0: 3 + 4/(0 - 2) = 3 + 4/(-2) = 3 - 2 = 1. Correct. So that confirms the same results. So adding them up gives 2 + 5/3 + 1 = 14/3. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this? Let me think. But I think the straightforward substitution is sufficient here. Since all the steps check out, and I verified using two different forms of the function, I think 14/3 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me recompute the sum once more. 2 is equal to 2/1, 5/3 is 5/3, and 1 is 1/1. To add them, common denominator is 3. So 2 = 6/3, 5/3 stays as is, and 1 = 3/3. Then 6/3 + 5/3 + 3/3 = (6 + 5 + 3)/3 = 14/3. Yep, same result. So that's solid.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 14/3. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The function is defined at all the points we're evaluating, and the arithmetic checks out. So I feel confident about this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $ f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) $ is \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of $ f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) $ for the function  \n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{3x - 2}{x - 2},\n$$  \nwe will evaluate the function at each of the given points and then sum the results.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate $ f(-2) $\n\nSubstitute $ x = -2 $ into the function:\n\n$$\nf(-2) = \\frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} = \\frac{-6 - 2}{-4} = \\frac{-8}{-4} = 2\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate $ f(-1) $\n\nSubstitute $ x = -1 $:\n\n$$\nf(-1) = \\frac{3(-1) - 2}{-1 - 2} = \\frac{-3 - 2}{-3} = \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate $ f(0) $\n\nSubstitute $ x = 0 $:\n\n$$\nf(0) = \\frac{3(0) - 2}{0 - 2} = \\frac{-2}{-2} = 1\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Add the results\n\nNow, we sum the three values:\n\n$$\nf(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + \\frac{5}{3} + 1\n$$\n\nConvert all terms to have a common denominator of 3:\n\n$$\n2 = \\frac{6}{3}, \\quad 1 = \\frac{3}{3}\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n\\frac{6}{3} + \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{14}{3}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}\n$$", "label": "\\frac{14}{3}", "reward": 1}

Alright, let me start by recalling how to evaluate a function at specific points. Basically, I just substitute the given x-values into the function and compute each term separately, then add them up. Let me write that down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me handle f(-2). So replacing x with -2 in the function:\n\nf(-2) = [3*(-2) - 2]/[-2 - 2]\n\nLet me compute the numerator and denominator separately. The numerator is 3 times -2, which is -6, minus 2. So that's -6 - 2 = -8. The denominator is -2 - 2, which is -4. So f(-2) is -8 divided by -4. Dividing two negatives gives a positive, so that's 2. Okay, so f(-2) = 2. Got that.\n\nNext, let's compute f(-1). Again, substitute x = -1 into the function:\n\nf(-1) = [3*(-1) - 2]/[-1 - 2]\n\nCalculating numerator: 3*(-1) is -3, minus 2 is -3 - 2 = -5. Denominator: -1 - 2 is -3. So f(-1) is -5 divided by -3. Again, two negatives make a positive, so that's 5/3. So f(-1) = 5/3. Alright.\n\nNow, moving on to f(0). Substitute x = 0 into the function:\n\nf(0) = [3*(0) - 2]/[0 - 2]\n\nNumerator: 3*0 is 0, minus 2 is -2. Denominator: 0 - 2 is -2. Therefore, f(0) is -2 divided by -2, which is 1. So f(0) = 1. \n\nNow, adding them all up: f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + 5/3 + 1. Let me compute that. First, 2 + 1 is 3, so 3 + 5/3. To add these, I can convert 3 to thirds: 3 is 9/3. Then 9/3 + 5/3 = 14/3. \n\nWait, so the total is 14/3? Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with f(-2): [3*(-2) -2]/[-2 -2] = (-6 -2)/(-4) = (-8)/(-4) = 2. Correct.\n\nf(-1): [3*(-1) -2]/[-1 -2] = (-3 -2)/(-3) = (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. Correct.\n\nf(0): [0 -2]/[0 -2] = (-2)/(-2) = 1. Correct.\n\nAdding them: 2 + 5/3 + 1. 2 + 1 is 3. 3 + 5/3. 3 is 9/3, so 9/3 + 5/3 = 14/3. Yes, that seems right. \n\nBut let me check if there's any possibility that I misread the function. The function is (3x - 2)/(x - 2). So, for example, when x is -2, denominator is -2 - 2 = -4, numerator is 3*(-2) -2 = -6 -2 = -8. Yep, that's right. \n\nAnother thing to check: Are there any restrictions on the domain? The function is undefined when x - 2 = 0, so x \u2260 2. But since we are plugging in -2, -1, and 0, none of which are 2, so all three values are valid. So no issues there.\n\nSo, adding up 2 + 5/3 + 1. Let me convert all to fractions. 2 is 2/1, 5/3 is 5/3, 1 is 1/1. To add them, common denominator is 3. So 2/1 = 6/3, 5/3 stays, 1/1 = 3/3. So 6/3 + 5/3 + 3/3 = (6 + 5 + 3)/3 = 14/3. Yep, same result. \n\nSo I think 14/3 is the correct answer. Let me just make sure there's no calculation error in the individual terms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute each term as decimals to check. \n\nf(-2) = 2.0\n\nf(-1) = 5/3 \u2248 1.6667\n\nf(0) = 1.0\n\nAdding them: 2 + 1.6667 + 1 = 4.6667. Now, 14 divided by 3 is approximately 4.666..., which matches.

Substitute x with -1:\n\nf(-1) = [3*(-1) - 2]/[-1 - 2]\n\nCalculating the numerator: 3*(-1) is -3, minus 2 is -3 - 2 = -5. The denominator is -1 - 2 = -3. So f(-1) is -5 divided by -3.

So no issues there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check by plugging in the values again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the function in another form? Let me see. Maybe perform the division or something? Let me try to simplify f(x) first. Let's see:\n\nf(x) = (3x - 2)/(x - 2). Maybe I can do polynomial division or express it as a mixed number?\n\nLet me try dividing 3x - 2 by x - 2. So, how many times does x - 2 go into 3x - 2?\n\nWell, divide 3x by x, which is 3. Multiply 3 by (x - 2) gives 3x - 6. Subtract that from 3x - 2:\n\n(3x - 2) - (3x - 6) = 3x - 2 - 3x + 6 = 4. So the division gives 3 with a remainder of 4, so f(x) can be written as 3 + 4/(x - 2). Let me check that:\n\n3 + 4/(x - 2) = [3(x - 2) + 4]/(x - 2) = [3x - 6 + 4]/(x - 2) = (3x - 2)/(x - 2). Yes, that's correct. So f(x) = 3 + 4/(x - 2).

Correct.\n\nAdding them up: 2 + 5/3 + 1. 2 + 1 is 3. 3 + 5/3. 3 is 9/3, so 9/3 + 5/3 is 14/3. Yes, that seems correct. \n\nWait, but 14/3 is an improper fraction. The question says to express the answer as a common fraction, so 14/3 is already a common fraction. So I think that's the answer. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's any possibility that I made a mistake in substitution. For example, maybe I misread the function? Let me check the original problem again: f(x) = (3x - 2)/(x - 2). Yes, that's what it says. So no issues there.\n\nAnother thing to check: are there any restrictions on the domain? The function is undefined when the denominator is zero, which is when x - 2 = 0, so x = 2. But none of the values we are evaluating, -2, -1, 0, are equal to 2, so all three are valid. So no issues there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check by simplifying the function first? Let me see if f(x) can be simplified. Let me try to perform the division or see if it can be rewritten.\n\nSo f(x) = (3x - 2)/(x - 2). Maybe I can do polynomial division or something. Let me try dividing 3x - 2 by x - 2.\n\nDividing 3x - 2 by x - 2. The leading term is 3x divided by x, which is 3. Multiply (x - 2) by 3: 3x - 6. Subtract that from 3x - 2: (3x - 2) - (3x - 6) = 3x - 2 - 3x + 6 = 4. So the division gives 3 with a remainder of 4. Therefore, f(x) can be written as 3 + 4/(x - 2). \n\nSo f(x) = 3 + 4/(x - 2). Maybe this form is easier to compute? Let me check with x = -2. \n\nFor f(-2): 3 + 4/(-2 - 2) = 3 + 4/(-4) = 3 - 1 = 2. Which matches what I had before. Good.\n\nFor f(-1): 3 + 4/(-1 - 2) = 3 + 4/(-3) = 3 - 4/3 = 9/3 - 4/3 = 5/3. Correct again.\n\nFor f(0): 3 + 4/(0 - 2) = 3 + 4/(-2) = 3 - 2 = 1. Correct. \n\nSo adding them up again: 2 + 5/3 + 1 = 14/3. So same result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of f(x) as 3 + 4/(x - 2), so when I add f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0), it's [3 + 3 + 3] + [4/(-4) + 4/(-3) + 4/(-2)]. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, f(-2) is 3 + 4/(-4), f(-1) is 3 + 4/(-3), f(0) is 3 + 4/(-2). Therefore, adding them up:\n\n3 + 3 + 3 + [4/(-4) + 4/(-3) + 4/(-2)] = 9 + [ -1 - 4/3 - 2 ].\n\nCalculating the bracket part: -1 - 2 is -3, then -3 - 4/3 is - (3 + 4/3) = - (9/3 + 4/3) = -13/3. Therefore total is 9 - 13/3. Converting 9 to thirds: 27/3 - 13/3 = 14/3. Same answer. So that's another way to get 14/3. \n\nTherefore, I think that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with decimal approximations? Let me see. \n\nf(-2) is 2. f(-1) is 5/3 \u2248 1.666..., f(0) is 1. Adding them up: 2 + 1.666... + 1 = 4.666..., which is 14/3 since 14 divided by 3 is approximately 4.666... So that checks out. \n\nSo I think I can be confident that the answer is 14/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $ f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) $ is \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of $ f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) $, where the function is defined as:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{3x - 2}{x - 2}\n$$\n\nwe will evaluate the function at each of the given inputs, simplify the results, and then add them together.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate $ f(-2) $\n\n$$\nf(-2) = \\frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} = \\frac{-6 - 2", "label": "\\frac{14}{3}", "reward": 1}

I need to find the value of f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) where the function f(x) is given as (3x - 2)/(x - 2). Alright, so first, I should probably figure out what each of these individual function values is, and then add them up. Let me start with f(-2).\n\nSo, f(-2) would be plugging in -2 wherever there's an x in the function. Let me write that out. So, substituting x = -2 into the numerator: 3*(-2) - 2. Let me calculate that. 3 times -2 is -6, and then minus 2... so that would be -6 - 2, which is -8. Then the denominator is x - 2, so that's -2 - 2. Which is -4. So f(-2) is -8 divided by -4. Hmm, dividing two negatives gives a positive, so that would be 2. Okay, so f(-2) is 2. Got that part.\n\nNow moving on to f(-1). Again, substitute x = -1 into the function. The numerator is 3*(-1) - 2. Let me compute that. 3 times -1 is -3, minus 2... so that's -3 - 2, which is -5. The denominator is x - 2, so that's -1 - 2. Which is -3. Therefore, f(-1) is -5 divided by -3. Again, two negatives make a positive, so that's 5/3. So f(-1) is 5/3. Alright.\n\nNext up is f(0). Let me substitute x = 0 into the function. The numerator is 3*(0) - 2. That's 0 - 2, which is -2. The denominator is 0 - 2, which is -2. So f(0) is -2 divided by -2. That simplifies to 1. So f(0) is 1. \n\nNow, I need to add up these three results: f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + 5/3 + 1. Let me compute that. First, 2 + 1 is 3, and then adding 5/3. So 3 is the same as 9/3, right? So 9/3 + 5/3 is 14/3. Therefore, the total sum should be 14/3. \n\nWait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when I do arithmetic quickly, I might slip up. Let me verify each function value again.\n\nStarting with f(-2): numerator 3*(-2) - 2 = -6 - 2 = -8. Denominator: -2 - 2 = -4. So -8/-4 = 2. Correct. Then f(-1): 3*(-1) - 2 = -3 - 2 = -5. Denominator: -1 - 2 = -3. So -5/-3 = 5/3. That's right. Then f(0): 3*0 - 2 = -2. Denominator: 0 - 2 = -2. So -2/-2 = 1. Correct. \n\nAdding them up: 2 + 5/3 + 1. Let me convert them all to thirds. 2 is 6/3, 5/3 is 5/3, and 1 is 3/3. So 6/3 + 5/3 + 3/3 = (6 + 5 + 3)/3 = 14/3. Yeah, that's 14 over 3. So that seems correct. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any chance that I made a mistake in substituting the values? For example, maybe I misread the function? The function is (3x - 2)/(x - 2). Let me check once more for f(-2). Yes, numerator: 3*(-2) is -6, minus 2 is -8. Denominator: -2 - 2 is -4. Correct. \n\nAnother thing to check: are there any restrictions on the domain of the function? The denominator can't be zero, so x can't be 2. But since we are plugging in -2, -1, and 0, none of those are 2, so there's no issue here. So all the function values are defined. \n\nTherefore, adding them up gives 14/3. So I think that's the correct answer. Let me just write that as a common fraction, which is already in the form of 14/3. So I think that's the answer. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute the sum again. 2 is 2.0, 5/3 is approximately 1.666..., and 1 is 1.0. Adding them together: 2 + 1.666... + 1 = 4.666..., and 14 divided by 3 is approximately 4.666..., which matches.

Alright, let me start by recalling how to evaluate a function at specific points. Basically, I just substitute the given x-values into the function and compute each term separately, then add them up. Let me write that down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me handle f(-2). So replacing every x in the function with -2. That would be (3*(-2) - 2)/(-2 - 2). Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately. The numerator is 3 times -2, which is -6, minus 2. So that's -6 - 2 = -8. The denominator is -2 - 2, which is -4. So f(-2) is -8 divided by -4. Dividing two negatives gives a positive, so that's 2. Okay, so f(-2) is 2. Got that.\n\nNext, let's do f(-1). Again, substitute x with -1. So numerator is 3*(-1) - 2. Let me calculate that: 3*(-1) is -3, minus 2 is -3 - 2 = -5. The denominator is -1 - 2, which is -3. Therefore, f(-1) is -5 divided by -3. Again, two negatives make a positive, so that's 5/3. Hmm, okay, so f(-1) is 5/3.\n\nNow, moving on to f(0). Substitute x with 0. Numerator becomes 3*(0) - 2. That's 0 - 2 = -2. Denominator is 0 - 2, which is -2. Therefore, f(0) is -2 divided by -2. That simplifies to 1. So f(0) is 1.\n\nNow, adding them all up: f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + 5/3 + 1. Let me compute that. First, 2 + 1 is 3, so then adding 5/3. So 3 + 5/3. To add these, I need a common denominator. 3 can be written as 9/3, so 9/3 + 5/3 = 14/3. Therefore, the total sum is 14/3. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with f(-2): (3*(-2) - 2)/(-2 - 2) = (-6 -2)/(-4) = -8/-4 = 2. Correct.

So 14 over 3. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's any possible mistake here. For example, did I substitute the values correctly? Let me check f(-2) again. The function is (3x - 2)/(x - 2). So for x = -2, numerator: 3*(-2) is -6, minus 2 is -8. Denominator: -2 - 2 is -4. So -8/-4 is 2. Correct. Similarly for f(-1): 3*(-1) is -3, minus 2 is -5. Denominator: -1 - 2 is -3. So -5/-3 is 5/3. Correct. For f(0): 3*0 is 0, minus 2 is -2. Denominator: 0 - 2 is -2. So -2/-2 is 1. Correct. Then adding them: 2 + 5/3 + 1. Let me convert 2 and 1 to thirds. 2 is 6/3, 1 is 3/3. So 6/3 + 5/3 + 3/3 = (6 + 5 + 3)/3 = 14/3. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo I think that's the correct answer. 14/3. Let me just make sure that there's no restriction on the domain or anything. The original function f(x) is (3x - 2)/(x - 2). The denominator is x - 2, so x cannot be 2. But since we are evaluating at -2, -1, and 0, none of which are 2, so there's no issue with division by zero here. Therefore, all the values are valid.

{"prompt": "How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.", "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a divisor is. A divisor of a number is another number that divides it without leaving a remainder. So, for example, 2 is a divisor of 4 because 4 divided by 2 is 2, which is a whole number. But 3 isn't a divisor of 4 because 4 divided by 3 is 1.333..., which isn't a whole number.\n\nNow, the question is about 196. I need to find all the positive integers that can divide 196 without leaving a remainder. But doing this manually for 196 might take a while, especially if I have to check each number one by one. There must be a smarter way to do this. I remember something about prime factorization being useful for finding the number of divisors. Let me try to remember how that works.\n\nI think the process involves breaking down the number into its prime factors. Once you have the prime factors, you can use their exponents to determine the number of divisors. The formula, if I recall correctly, is to take each exponent from the prime factorization, add 1 to each of those exponents, and then multiply them all together. That product gives the total number of positive divisors. Let me verify if that's correct.\n\nFor example, take a number like 12. Its prime factors are 2^2 * 3^1. According to the formula, we add 1 to each exponent: (2+1)*(1+1) = 3*2 = 6. And indeed, the divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. That's 6 divisors. So the formula works here. Okay, so I can use this method for 196.\n\nFirst, I need to find the prime factorization of 196. Let me start dividing 196 by the smallest prime numbers.\n\n196 is even, so it's divisible by 2. Let's divide by 2:\n\n196 \u00f7 2 = 98\n\n98 is also even, so divide by 2 again:\n\n98 \u00f7 2 = 49\n\nNow, 49 is not even. Let me check if it's divisible by 3. 4 + 9 = 13, which isn't divisible by 3, so 3 isn't a factor. Next prime is 5, but 49 doesn't end with 0 or 5, so no. Next is 7. Let's check 49 \u00f7 7 = 7. So that's 7*7. Therefore, the prime factors of 196 are 2^2 * 7^2.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 2*2*7*7 is 4*49 = 196. Yes, that's correct. So the prime factorization is 2 squared times 7 squared.\n\nSo according to the formula, the exponents are 2 and 2. Adding 1 to each gives 3 and 3. Multiplying them together: 3*3 = 9. Therefore, 196 should have 9 positive divisors. Let me check that by listing them out to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 1, which divides every number. Then 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Wait, let me count them:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. That's 9 numbers. Okay, that matches the calculation. So the answer is 9. But let me make sure I didn't miss any divisors.\n\nAnother way to list them is to take all combinations of the prime factors. Since the prime factors are 2^2 * 7^2, the exponents for 2 can be 0, 1, or 2, and the exponents for 7 can be 0, 1, or 2. So each combination gives a unique divisor.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 2^0 * 7^0 = 1\n- 2^1 * 7^0 = 2\n- 2^2 * 7^0 = 4\n- 2^0 * 7^1 = 7\n- 2^1 * 7^1 = 14\n- 2^2 * 7^1 = 28\n- 2^0 * 7^2 = 49\n- 2^1 * 7^2 = 98\n- 2^2 * 7^2 = 196\n\nYep, that's 3 choices for the exponent of 2 and 3 choices for the exponent of 7, so 3*3=9 divisors. That seems solid.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't skip any numbers. Let me check if there's a divisor between, say, 28 and 49. For example, 28 is 28, then next is 49. What about 14? 14 is already listed. 7 is there. 4, 2, 1. Then 98 and 196. So between 28 and 49, there's 49. Is there a number like 35? Let me check if 35 divides 196. 35 times 5 is 175, 35 times 5.6 is 196. So 196 divided by 35 is 5.6, which isn't an integer. So 35 isn't a divisor. How about 14? 14 is there. 28 is there. How about 49? Yes, that's there. So no, there are no other divisors. So 9 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I list all the divisors in pairs:\n\n1 and 196\n\n2 and 98\n\n4 and 49\n\n7 and 28\n\n14 and 14\n\nWait, so that's 1, 196, 2, 98, 4, 49, 7, 28, 14. So that's 9 divisors. The pair (14,14) is just one number, so that's why we don't double count. So that's another way to see it. So that's 9 divisors. So that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many **positive whole-number divisors** the number **196** has, we can use a systematic mathematical approach involving **prime factorization** and a formula for counting divisors.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 196\n\nWe begin by breaking 196 into its **prime factors**:\n\n- 196 \u00f7 2 = 98  \n- 98 \u00f7 2 = 49  \n- 49 \u00f7 7 = 7  \n- 7 \u00f7 7 = 1  \n\nSo, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n\n$$\n196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Formula for Counting Divisors\n\nIf a number $ N $ has a prime factorization of the form:\n\n$$\nN = p_1^{e_1} \\times p_2^{e_2} \\times \\dots \\times p_k^{e_k}\n$$\n\nthen the total number of **positive whole-number divisors** of $ N $ is:\n\n$$\n(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\dots (e_k + 1)\n$$\n\nIn our case:\n\n- $ e_1 = 2 $ (from $ 2^2 $)\n- $ e_2 = 2 $ (from $ 7^2 $)\n\nSo the number of divisors is:\n\n$$\n(2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Verification by Listing Divisors\n\nTo confirm, we can list all the divisors of 196:\n\n1. $ 2^0 \\times 7^0 = 1 $  \n2. $ 2^1 \\times 7^0 = 2 $  \n3. $ 2^2 \\times 7^0 = 4 $  \n4. $ 2^0 \\times 7^1 = 7 $  \n5. $ 2^1 \\times 7^1 = 14 $  \n6. $ 2^2 \\times 7^1 = 28 $  \n7. $ 2^0 \\times 7^2 = 49 $  \n8. $ 2^1 \\times 7^2 = 98 $  \n9. $ 2^2 \\times 7^2 = 196 $\n\nThese are exactly **9** divisors.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n", "label": "9", "reward": 1}

If I can express 196 as a product of prime numbers raised to their respective exponents, then there's a formula to find the number of divisors based on those exponents.

So, you take each exponent, add 1 to it, and multiply them all together. That gives the total number of divisors.\n\nOkay, so first step is to find the prime factorization of 196. Let me try to do that. Let's start dividing 196 by the smallest prime numbers.\n\nFirst, 196 is even, so it's divisible by 2. Let me divide 196 by 2: 196 \u00f7 2 = 98. Then 98 is also even, so divide by 2 again: 98 \u00f7 2 = 49. Now, 49 is not even, so 2 isn't a factor anymore. Next prime number is 3. Let me check if 49 is divisible by 3. 3 times 16 is 48, so 49 - 48 is 1, so no, not divisible by 3. Next prime is 5. 49 ends with a 9, so not divisible by 5. Next is 7. Let me check 49 \u00f7 7. That's 7. So 49 is 7 squared. So putting this all together:\n\n196 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7. Which is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2. Let me confirm that. 2 squared is 4, 7 squared is 49. 4 \u00d7 49 is 196. Yes, that's correct. So the prime factorization of 196 is $ 2^2 \\times 7^2 $.\n\nNow, according to the formula, the number of divisors is (exponent of 2 + 1) multiplied by (exponent of 7 + 1). The exponents here are both 2. So that would be (2 + 1) \u00d7 (2 + 1) = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9. So, does that mean 196 has 9 positive divisors?\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the prime factorization. Let me check again. Starting with 196:\n\nDivide by 2: 196 / 2 = 98\n\nDivide by 2 again: 98 / 2 = 49\n\nNow 49 divided by 7 is 7, and then divided by 7 again is 1. So yes, prime factors are 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2. So exponents are 2 and 2. So adding 1 to each gives 3 and 3. Multiply them: 3\u00d73=9. So 9 divisors. Let me list them out to confirm.\n\nStarting with 1, which divides every number. Then the primes: 2, 7. Then products of primes: 2\u00d72=4, 2\u00d77=14, 7\u00d77=49. Then products of more primes: 2\u00b2\u00d77=28, 2\u00d77\u00b2=98. And then the number itself, 196. Wait, let me count:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. That's 9 numbers. Let me check if I missed any. Let's see:\n\nStarting from 1:\n\n1\n\nThen 2, 4 (since 2\u00b2 is 4)\n\nThen 7, 14 (2\u00d77), 28 (4\u00d77)\n\nThen 49 (7\u00b2), 98 (2\u00d749), 196 (4\u00d749). Hmm, that's 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Yep, that's 9 divisors. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each divisor can be represented as 2^a * 7^b, where a can be 0, 1, or 2 (since the exponent of 2 is 2), and b can be 0, 1, or 2 (since the exponent of 7 is 2). So the number of combinations is 3 choices for a and 3 choices for b, so 3\u00d73=9. That matches.\n\nSo, that seems solid. Therefore, the answer should be 9. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the prime factorization, let me check another way. Let me see if 196 is a square number. Since 14 squared is 196 (14\u00d714=196). So, 14 is 2\u00d77, so 14 squared is (2\u00d77)^2 = 2\u00b2\u00d77\u00b2, which is exactly the prime factorization I had earlier. So that's correct.\n\nAnother check: the number of divisors. For example, if a number is a square, like 196, it has an odd number of divisors because one of the divisors is repeated (the square root). So, since 14 is the square root, and 14 is counted once. So, in our list above, 14 is there once. So, the total number of divisors is odd, which 9 is. So that makes sense. If it wasn't a square, the number of divisors would be even, because divisors come in pairs. For example, for 6, divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6. So 4 divisors, which is even. But for 4, which is a square, divisors are 1, 2, 4. Three divisors, odd. So that checks out. So 196 being a square number, having 9 divisors, which is odd, makes sense.\n\nSo, all my checks seem to confirm that 196 has 9 positive divisors. Therefore, I think the answer is 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many **positive whole-number divisors** the number **196** has, we can use a method based on **prime factorization** and a known formula for the number of divisors.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 196\n\nWe start by breaking down 196 into its prime factors:\n\n- 196 is even, so divide by 2:  \n  $ 196 \\div 2 = 98 $  \n- 98 is also even, divide by 2 again:  \n  $ 98 \\div 2 = 49 $  \n- 49 is not divisible by 2.

Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.", "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has. Hmm, let me remember. I think the standard way to do this is by finding the prime factorization of the number first, and then using that to determine the number of divisors. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFirst, prime factorization. So, breaking down 196 into its prime factors. Let me start dividing by the smallest primes. 196 is even, so it's divisible by 2. Let me do that: 196 divided by 2 is 98. Then 98 divided by 2 is 49. Okay, so that's 2 squared. Now 49 is 7 times 7, right? So 49 is 7 squared. So putting that all together, 196 is 2 squared times 7 squared. So, in exponent form, that's 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2. Let me check that: 2\u00b2 is 4, 7\u00b2 is 49, and 4 times 49 is 196. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, once I have the prime factorization, how do I find the number of divisors? I think the formula is to take the exponents of each prime, add 1 to each of those exponents, and then multiply them together. So for example, if a number has a prime factorization of p^a \u00d7 q^b, then the number of divisors is (a+1)(b+1). Let me confirm that. \n\nSo, for instance, take a simpler number like 12, which is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b9. Then the number of divisors should be (2+1)(1+1) = 3\u00d72=6. Let me list them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Yep, that's six. So that works. So applying that to 196, which is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2. So the exponents are 2 and 2. Adding 1 to each gives 3 and 3. Multiplying them together: 3\u00d73=9. So does that mean 196 has 9 positive divisors?\n\nWait, let me check by listing them to be sure. Let's see. Starting with 1, then 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Let me count: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. That's 9 divisors. Okay, that matches. So that seems right.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't miss any, let me think of another way. For each prime factor, the exponent tells me how many times that prime can appear in a divisor. For 2\u00b2, the exponents for 2 in the divisors can be 0, 1, or 2. Similarly for 7\u00b2, the exponents can be 0, 1, or 2. So the total number of combinations is 3\u00d73=9. That makes sense. Each combination of exponents gives a unique divisor. For example:\n\n- 2^0 \u00d7 7^0 = 1\n- 2^1 \u00d7 7^0 = 2\n- 2^2 \u00d7 7^0 = 4\n- 2^0 \u00d7 7^1 = 7\n- 2^1 \u00d7 7^1 = 14\n- 2^2 \u00d7 7^1 = 28\n- 2^0 \u00d7 7^2 = 49\n- 2^1 \u00d7 7^2 = 98\n- 2^2 \u00d7 7^2 = 196\n\nYep, that's nine divisors. So that checks out. So the answer is 9. Therefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the prime factorization. Let me try dividing 196 by some numbers. 196 divided by 2 is 98, divided by 2 again is 49. Then 49 divided by 7 is 7, divided by 7 is 1. So that's 2\u00d72\u00d77\u00d77, which is 2\u00b2\u00d77\u00b2. Correct. So that's right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of 196 as 14 squared. Since 14 is 2\u00d77, then 14 squared is (2\u00d77)\u00b2 = 2\u00b2\u00d77\u00b2. So same result. So that's another way to see it. So that's consistent.\n\nAnother check: if I list all the divisors, as I did before, and count them, I get 9. So that seems solid. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The process seems correct. So I think the answer is 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many **positive whole-number divisors** the number 196 has, we begin by analyzing its **prime factorization**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization\n\nWe divide 196 by the smallest prime number, 2:\n\n- $ 196 \\div 2 = 98 $\n- $ 98 \\div 2 = 49 $\n\nNow 49 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime, 7:\n\n- $ 49 \\div 7 = 7 $\n- $ 7 \\div 7 = 1 $\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n\n$$\n196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Formula for Number of Divisors\n\nThe general formula to find the number of positive divisors of a number from its prime factorization is:\n\n$$\n\\text{If } n = p^a \\times q^b \\times \\dots \\text{ then the number of divisors is } (a+1)(b+1)\\dots\n$$\n\nApplying this to $ 196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2 $:\n\n- The exponents are 2 and 2.\n- Add 1 to each exponent: $ 2 + 1 = 3 $, $ 2 + 1 = 3 $.\n- Multiply the results: $ 3 \\times 3 = 9 $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Verification by Listing Divisors\n\nTo double-check, we can list all positive divisors of 196:\n\n$$\n1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196\n$$\n\nCounting them confirms there are **9** divisors.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{9}\n$$", "label": "9", "reward": 1}

I remember that to find the number of divisors of a number, you first have to find its prime factorization. Once you have that, there's a formula or something involving the exponents of the prime factors. Let me try to recall.\n\nFirst, let me start by factoring 196. Let me see, 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Let me divide 196 by 2. 196 divided by 2 is 98. Then 98 divided by 2 is 49. Okay, so that's two 2s. Now 49, I know that's 7 times 7. So putting that all together, 196 is 2 squared times 7 squared. So the prime factorization is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2. Let me check that: 2\u00b2 is 4, 7\u00b2 is 49, and 4 \u00d7 49 is 196. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, the formula for the number of divisors. If a number N has a prime factorization of the form p\u2081^a \u00d7 p\u2082^b \u00d7 ... \u00d7 p\u2099^k, then the number of positive divisors is (a+1)(b+1)...(k+1). Right? So each exponent is increased by one and then multiplied together. Let me confirm this with a simpler number. Let's take 12, which factors into 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b9. Then the number of divisors should be (2+1)(1+1) = 3\u00d72=6. Let's list them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Yep, that's six. So the formula works.\n\nSo applying that to 196. Its prime factors are 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2. So the exponents are 2 and 2. Therefore, the number of divisors is (2+1)(2+1) = 3\u00d73=9. So 9 divisors. Let me check by listing them to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 1, then 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Let me count: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. That's 9 numbers. Okay, that matches. So the answer should be 9.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any divisors. Let me think of another way. For each prime factor, the exponents can range from 0 up to the exponent in the factorization. So for 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2, the exponents for 2 can be 0, 1, or 2, and the exponents for 7 can be 0, 1, or 2. So the total combinations are 3\u00d73=9. Each combination gives a unique divisor. For example:\n\n- 2^0 \u00d7 7^0 = 1\n- 2^1 \u00d7 7^0 = 2\n- 2^2 \u00d7 7^0 = 4\n- 2^0 \u00d7 7^1 = 7\n- 2^1 \u00d7 7^1 = 14\n- 2^2 \u00d7 7^1 = 28\n- 2^0 \u00d7 7^2 = 49\n- 2^1 \u00d7 7^2 = 98\n- 2^2 \u00d7 7^2 = 196\n\nYep, that's 9 divisors. So that checks out. So I think 9 is the correct answer. But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the prime factorization. 196 divided by 2 is 98, divided by 2 is 49, which is 7 squared. So 2\u00b2\u00d77\u00b2. Correct. So the exponents are both 2. So (2+1)(2+1)=9. So yeah, I think that's right.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't remember the formula, I could list all the divisors. Let me try that again. Starting from 1 and going up to 196, checking which numbers divide 196.\n\n1 divides 196. 2 divides 196. 3? 196 divided by 3 is about 65.333... so no. 4? 196 divided by 4 is 49, which is exact. 5? Doesn't end with 0 or 5. 6? Not divisible by 2 and 3. 7? 196 divided by 7 is 28. 8? 196 divided by 8 is 24.5, nope. 9? 196 divided by 9 is about 21.777... nope. 10? No. 11? 196 divided by 11 is around 17.8... nope. 12? No. 13? 196 divided by 13 is about 15.07... nope. 14? 14 times 14 is 196? Wait, 14 times 14 is 196? Let me check. 14\u00d714 is 196. Yes, because 14\u00d710=140, 14\u00d74=56, 140+56=196. So 14 is a divisor. Then 15? No. 16? 196 divided by 16 is 12.25. No. 17? No. 18? No. 19? No. 20? No. 21? 21\u00d79 is 189, 21\u00d79.333... so no. 22? No. 23? No. 24? No. 25? No. 26? No. 27? No. 28? 28\u00d77 is 196. Yes, 28. Then 29? No. 30? No. ... up to 49. 49 divides 196 because 49\u00d74=196. Then 98 divides 196, since 98\u00d72=196. And 196 itself. So the divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. That's 9 divisors. Yep, same as before.\n\nSo whether I use the formula or list them out, I get 9. So I think that's solid.

Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.", "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a divisor is. A divisor of a number is another number that divides it without leaving a remainder. So, for example, 2 is a divisor of 4 because 4 divided by 2 is 2, which is a whole number. But 3 isn't a divisor of 4 because 4 divided by 3 is 1.333..., which isn't a whole number.\n\nNow, the question is about 196. I need to find all the positive integers that can divide 196 without leaving a remainder. But doing this manually by checking each number from 1 up to 196 would take a long time. There must be a smarter way to do this. I remember something about prime factorization being useful for finding the number of divisors. Let me try to remember how that works.\n\nFirst, I think you have to break down the number into its prime factors. Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. Once you have the prime factorization, there's a formula or method to calculate the number of divisors. Let me try to recall that formula.\n\nI think if a number N has a prime factorization of the form N = p^a * q^b * r^c..., where p, q, r, etc., are prime numbers, then the number of positive divisors of N is (a+1)*(b+1)*(c+1)*... and so on for each exponent. So, each exponent is increased by one and then multiplied together. Is that right? Let me check with a simple number. Let's take 6, which factors into 2^1 * 3^1. According to the formula, the number of divisors would be (1+1)*(1+1) = 2*2 = 4. And indeed, the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6. That's four divisors. Okay, that seems to work.\n\nSo, applying this to 196. First, I need to find its prime factors. Let me start dividing 196 by the smallest primes.\n\n196 is even, so it's divisible by 2. Let me divide by 2:\n\n196 \u00f7 2 = 98.\n\n98 is also even, so divide by 2 again:\n\n98 \u00f7 2 = 49.\n\nNow, 49 is not even. Let me check if it's divisible by 3. 4+9=13, which isn't divisible by 3. Next prime is 5, but 49 doesn't end with 0 or 5. Next is 7. 49 \u00f7 7 = 7. So, 49 is 7 squared.\n\nSo putting it all together, 196 factors into 2^2 * 7^2. Let me verify that. 2 squared is 4, 7 squared is 49. 4*49 is 196. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo according to the formula, the number of divisors is (2+1)*(2+1) = 3*3 = 9. So, 9 positive divisors. But let me check this by actually listing them to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 1, which divides every number. Then 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Wait, let me count:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. That's 9 numbers. Okay, that matches the calculation. So, the answer should be 9. But let me make sure I didn't miss any divisors.\n\nLet me think. Let's list them in pairs:\n\n1 and 196 (since 1*196=196)\n\n2 and 98 (2*98=196)\n\n4 and 49 (4*49=196)\n\n7 and 28 (7*28=196)\n\n14 and 14 (14*14=196). Wait, 14 squared is 196? Let me check 14*14. 14*10=140, 14*4=56, so 140+56=196. Yes, that's correct. So, 14 is a divisor, and it's a square root, so it's only counted once.\n\nSo the divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. That's 9 divisors. So that's correct. Therefore, the formula works here.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the prime factorization. Let me check again. 196 divided by 2 is 98, divided by 2 is 49. 49 is 7 squared. So 2^2 * 7^2. Correct. So exponents are 2 and 2. So (2+1)*(2+1)=9. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't remember the formula, I could think of generating all the divisors by combining the prime factors. Since the prime factors are 2^2 and 7^2, any divisor must be of the form 2^a * 7^b, where a can be 0, 1, or 2, and b can be 0, 1, or 2. So, for a, there are 3 choices (0,1,2) and for b, 3 choices (0,1,2). So total number of divisors is 3*3=9. That's another way to think about it.

{"prompt": "How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.", "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has. Hmm, let me think. I remember that to find the number of divisors of a number, you first have to find its prime factorization. Once you have that, there's a formula or something involving the exponents of the prime factors. Let me try to recall.\n\nFirst, let me try to factor 196. Let's start by dividing by the smallest prime numbers. 196 is even, so it's divisible by 2. 196 divided by 2 is 98. Then 98 divided by 2 is 49. Okay, so that's 2 squared times 49. Now, 49 is 7 times 7, right? So 49 is 7 squared. So putting that all together, 196 is 2 squared times 7 squared. So the prime factorization of 196 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2.\n\nNow, I think the formula for the number of divisors is to take the exponents of each prime factor, add 1 to each of those exponents, and then multiply them together. Let me check if that's correct. For example, if a number has a prime factorization of p^a \u00d7 q^b, then the number of divisors is (a+1)(b+1). Yeah, that sounds right. Because for each prime, you can choose an exponent from 0 up to the exponent in the factorization. So for 2\u00b2, the exponents possible are 0, 1, or 2. Similarly for 7\u00b2, exponents 0, 1, or 2. So the total number of combinations is 3 \u00d7 3 = 9. Therefore, 196 should have 9 positive divisors.\n\nWait, let me verify that by actually listing them. Let's see. Starting with 1, which divides every number. Then 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Wait, let me count that. 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. That's 9 divisors. Okay, that matches. So the formula works here.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss any. Let me list them again:\n\n1. 1\n2. 2\n3. 4\n4. 7\n5. 14 (which is 2\u00d77)\n6. 28 (which is 4\u00d77 or 2\u00b2\u00d77)\n7. 49 (which is 7\u00b2)\n8. 98 (which is 2\u00d749 or 2\u00d77\u00b2)\n9. 196 (which is 4\u00d749 or 2\u00b2\u00d77\u00b2)\n\nYep, that's nine. So that seems correct. So the answer is 9. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the prime factorization. Let me check 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2. 2\u00b2 is 4, 7\u00b2 is 49. 4 \u00d7 49 is 196. Correct. So that's right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that if you have the prime factors, each divisor is a product of primes raised to powers less than or equal to their exponents in the factorization. So for 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2, the exponents for 2 can be 0, 1, or 2, and for 7, same. So 3 choices for the exponent of 2, 3 choices for exponent of 7, so 3\u00d73=9. Yep, that's the same as before.\n\nSo I think that's solid. Therefore, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many **positive whole-number divisors** the number **196** has, we follow a structured mathematical process.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization\n\nWe begin by finding the **prime factorization** of 196. This involves breaking the number down into its prime components:\n\n- 196 is even, so divide by 2:  \n  $ 196 \\div 2 = 98 $\n- 98 is also even:  \n  $ 98 \\div 2 = 49 $\n- 49 is not divisible by 2, but it is $ 7 \\times 7 $, so:  \n  $ 49 = 7^2 $\n\nSo the prime factorization of 196 is:\n\n$$\n196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use the Divisor Count Formula\n\nThere is a standard formula to find the number of **positive divisors** of a number based on its prime factorization.

Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.", "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a divisor is. A divisor of a number is another number that divides it without leaving a remainder. So, for example, 2 is a divisor of 4 because 4 divided by 2 is 2, which is a whole number. But 3 isn't a divisor of 4 because 4 divided by 3 is 1.333..., which isn't a whole number.\n\nNow, the question is about 196. I need to find all the positive integers that can divide 196 evenly. But instead of listing them all out, which might take a while, I remember there's a method involving prime factorization. Let me try to remember how that works.\n\nFirst, I think you have to break down the number into its prime factors. Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. Once you have the prime factorization, there's a formula or a method to determine the number of divisors. I think it's something like adding one to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiplying those together. Let me verify that.\n\nFor example, if a number N has a prime factorization of $ p^a \\times q^b \\times r^c $, then the number of divisors is $ (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) $. Yeah, that sounds right. Because for each prime factor, you can choose an exponent from 0 up to the exponent in the factorization, and the total combinations give all possible divisors.\n\nSo, first step: prime factorization of 196. Let me do that. Let's start dividing 196 by the smallest primes.\n\n196 is even, so it's divisible by 2. Let's divide by 2:\n\n196 \u00f7 2 = 98\n\n98 is also even, divide by 2 again:\n\n98 \u00f7 2 = 49\n\nNow, 49 is not even. Next prime is 3. 49 divided by 3 is not a whole number. Then 5? No, 49 ends with 9, so not divisible by 5. Next prime is 7. Let's check 49 \u00f7 7 = 7. So that's 7. Then 7 \u00f7 7 = 1. So the prime factors are 2, 2, 7, 7. So in exponent form, that's $ 2^2 \\times 7^2 $.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 2 squared is 4, 7 squared is 49. 4 times 49 is 196. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the prime factorization of 196 is $ 2^2 \\times 7^2 $. Now, applying the formula for the number of divisors. The exponents here are 2 and 2. So adding 1 to each gives 3 and 3. Multiplying them together: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9. So there should be 9 positive divisors.\n\nBut let me verify this by actually listing them out to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes formulas can be tricky if you misremember them.\n\nStarting with 1, since 1 divides every number. Then 2, since it's even. Then 4, because 196 divided by 4 is 49. Then 7, because 196 divided by 7 is 28. Then 14, since 14 \u00d7 14 is 196? Wait, no, 14 \u00d7 14 is 196? Wait, 14 squared is 196? Let me check. 14 \u00d7 14 is 196. Yes, because 10\u00d714=140, 4\u00d714=56, 140+56=196. So 14 is a divisor. Then 28, since 196 \u00f7 28 is 7. Then 49, since 196 \u00f7 49 is 4. Then 98, since 196 \u00f7 98 is 2. And finally 196 itself.\n\nSo listing them out: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. That's 9 divisors. Okay, that matches the result from the formula. So that seems correct.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss any. Let's see. Starting from 1:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Let me check if there are any others. For example, 3? 196 divided by 3 is about 65.333, not a whole number. 5? 196 ends with 6, so not divisible by 5. 6? Well, since it's not divisible by 3, it can't be divisible by 6. 8? 196 divided by 8 is 24.5, not whole. 9? 196 \u00f7 9 is about 21.777. 10? No. 11? 196 \u00f7 11 is about 17.81. 12? No. 13? 196 \u00f713 is around 15.07. 15? No. 16? 12.25. 17? 11.52. 18? 10.88. 19? 10.31. 20? 9.8. So none of these. So the divisors are indeed only those 9 numbers.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is using the exponents. Since the prime factors are 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2, the divisors are all numbers of the form 2^a \u00d7 7^b where a is 0,1,2 and b is 0,1,2. So for each exponent of 2, we can pair it with each exponent of 7.\n\nSo for a=0: 2^0 \u00d7 7^0 = 1; 2^0 \u00d7 7^1 = 7; 2^0 \u00d7 7^2 = 49.\n\nFor a=1: 2^1 \u00d7 7^0 = 2; 2^1 \u00d7 7^1 = 14; 2^1 \u00d7 7^2 = 98.\n\nFor a=2: 2^2 \u00d7 7^0 = 4; 2^2 \u00d7 7^1 = 28; 2^2 \u00d7 7^2 = 196.\n\nSo that gives 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 divisors. Yep, that's the same list as before. So that seems solid.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many **positive whole-number divisors** the number **196** has, we begin by analyzing its **prime factorization**.

But 3 isn't a divisor of 4 because 4 divided by 3 is 1.333..., which isn't a whole number.\n\nNow, the question is about 196. I need to find all the positive integers that can divide 196 without leaving a remainder. But doing this manually for 196 might take a while, especially if I have to check each number from 1 up to 196. There must be a smarter way to do this. I remember something about prime factorization being useful for finding the number of divisors. Let me try to remember how that works.\n\nI think the process involves breaking down the number into its prime factors. Once you have the prime factors, you can use their exponents to calculate the number of divisors. The formula, if I recall correctly, is to take each exponent from the prime factorization, add 1 to each of those exponents, and then multiply them all together. That product gives the total number of positive divisors. Let me verify if that makes sense.\n\nFor example, take a simpler number, like 12. The prime factorization of 12 is 2^2 * 3^1. According to the formula, we take the exponents 2 and 1, add 1 to each to get 3 and 2, then multiply them: 3*2=6. And indeed, 12 has 6 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. That checks out. So the formula seems to work.\n\nOkay, so I need to apply this to 196. First, let me find the prime factors of 196. Let's start dividing by the smallest primes.\n\n196 is even, so it's divisible by 2. 196 divided by 2 is 98. Then 98 is also even, so divide by 2 again: 98 / 2 = 49. Now, 49 is not even, so next prime is 3. 49 divided by 3 is not a whole number. Then 5? 49 divided by 5 is 9.8, not whole. Next prime is 7. 49 divided by 7 is 7. Then 7 divided by 7 is 1. So the prime factors are 2, 2, 7, 7. So in exponent form, that's 2^2 * 7^2.\n\nLet me check that. 2 squared is 4, 7 squared is 49. 4*49 is 196. Yes, that's correct. So the prime factorization of 196 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2.\n\nNow, applying the formula. The exponents here are 2 and 2. Adding 1 to each gives 3 and 3. Multiplying them together: 3*3=9. So, 196 should have 9 positive divisors. Let me verify that by listing them out to be sure.\n\nStarting with 1, which divides every number. Then 2, since it's even. 4, because 196 divided by 4 is 49. Then 7, since 196 divided by 7 is 28. 14, which is 2*7, and 196 divided by 14 is 14. Then 28, which is 4*7. 49, which is 7 squared. Then 98, which is 2*49. And finally 196 itself. Let me count these:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. That's 9 divisors. Perfect, that matches the calculation. So the formula works here.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any. Let me check each number between 1 and 196 to see if they divide 196. But that's tedious, but maybe I can check some numbers in between.\n\nFor example, 3: 196 divided by 3 is about 65.333... Not a whole number. 5: 196 divided by 5 is 39.2, nope. 6: 196/6 is about 32.666... Not whole. 8: 196/8 is 24.5, nope. 9: 196/9 is about 21.777... Not whole. 10: 19.6, nope. 11: 17.818... Nope. 12: 16.333... Nope. 13: 15.07... No. 15: 13.06... No. 16: 12.25... No. 17: 11.529... No. 18: 10.888... No. 19: 10.315... No. 20: 9.8... No. 21: 196 divided by 21 is about 9.333... No. 22: 8.909... No. 23: 8.521... No. 24: 8.166... No. 25: 7.84... No. 26: 7.538... No. 27: 7.259... No. 29: 6.758... No. 30: 6.533... No. 31: 6.322... No. 32: 6.125... No. 33: 5.939... No. 34: 5.764... No. 35: 5.6... Wait, 35? 35 times 5 is 175, 35 times 5.6 is 196? Let me check 35*5=175, 35*5.6=35*(5 + 0.6)=175 + 21=196. But 5.6 is not a whole number, so 35 isn't a divisor. So 35 isn't a divisor. So, seems like after 28, the next one is 49. So, the list I had earlier seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive divisors is indeed 9. So, the answer is 9. But just to make sure, let me think again about the prime factorization step. Maybe I made a mistake there?\n\n196 divided by 2 is 98, divided by 2 is 49. Then 49 divided by 7 is 7, divided by 7 is 1. So the prime factors are 2^2 * 7^2. Yes, that's correct. So exponents are 2 and 2. Then (2+1)*(2+1)=9. Yep. So that's solid.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each divisor is of the form 2^a * 7^b, where a can be 0, 1, or 2, and b can be 0, 1, or 2. Because the exponents in the prime factors can't exceed those in the original number. So for 2^a, a can be 0,1,2. Similarly for 7^b. So the number of possible combinations is 3*3=9. That also makes sense. For example:\n\nWhen a=0, b=0: 2^0*7^0=1\n\na=0, b=1: 7\n\na=0, b=2: 49\n\na=1, b=0: 2\n\na=1, b=1: 14\n\na=1, b=2: 98\n\na=2, b=0: 4\n\na=2, b=1: 28\n\na=2, b=2: 196\n\nYep, that's 9 divisors. So that's another way to think about it. So that's consistent with the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many **positive whole-number divisors** the number **196** has, we can use a mathematical method based on **prime factorization** and a well-known formula for counting divisors.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 196\n\nWe start by breaking 196 into its **prime factors**:\n\n-", "label": "9", "reward": 1}
