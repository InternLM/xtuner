## 🎉 News

- **\[2025/09\]** XTuner V1 Released! A Next-Generation Training Engine Built for Ultra-Large MoE Models

## 📖 XTuner V1

XTuner V1 is a next-generation LLM training engine specifically designed for ultra-large-scale MoE models. Unlike traditional 3D parallel training architectures, XTuner V1 is optimized for the mainstream MoE training scenarios prevalent in today's academic research.

### Key Features
**📊 Dropless Training**
	
  - **Scalable without complexity:** Train 200B-scale MoE models without expert parallelism; 600B models require only intra-node expert parallelism	
  - **Optimized parallelism strategy:** Smaller expert parallelism dimension compared to traditional 3D approaches, enabling more efficient Dropless training

**📝 Long Sequence Support**
	
  - **Memory-efficient design:** Train 200B MoE models on 64k sequence lengths without sequence parallelism through advanced memory optimization techniques	
  - **Flexible scaling:** Full support for DeepSpeed Ulysses sequence parallelism with linearly scalable maximum sequence length	
  - **Robust performance:** Maintains stability despite expert load imbalance during long sequence training

**⚡ Superior Efficiency**

  - **Massive scale:** Supports MoE training up to 1T parameters	
  - **Breakthrough performance:** First to achieve FSDP training throughput that surpasses traditional 3D parallel schemes for MoE models above 200B scale
  - **Hardware optimization:** Achieves training efficiency on Huawei Ascend A3 Supernode that exceeds NVIDIA H800

## 🔥 Roadmap

XTuner V1 is committed to continuously improving training efficiency for pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning of ultra-large MoE models, with special focus on Huawei Ascend NPU optimization.

### 🚀 Training Engine

Our vision is to establish XTuner V1 as a versatile training backend that seamlessly integrates with the broader open-source ecosystem.
